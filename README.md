This library provides an embedded `no_std` driver for the [Sensirion SGP41 sensor](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/gas-sensors/sgp41/). This driver was built using [embedded-hal](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/) traits. The implementaion is based on [scd4x](https://github.com/hauju/scd4x-rs.git) and [sgp40-rs](https://github.com/mjaakkol/sgp40-rs.git).

## Sensirion SGP41

The SGP41 is Sensirionâ€™s new VOC and NOx sensor designed as digital smart switch and regulation unit for air treatment devices such as air purifiers.
